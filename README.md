üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

This project is a simple URL shortener built with Laravel. It allows users to submit long URLs and generates shortened versions using a custom slicing algorithm. All URLs are stored in a database, and users can retrieve the list of saved links or be redirected to the original URL via the short version. The system ensures input validation and provides clear JSON responses for both success and error cases.
